## About This Website

This site is a personal space where I share my projects, thoughts, and creative endeavors. It is built using the **Millennial Template** created by LeNPAUL—a fantastic starting point that blends modern aesthetics with a timeless, minimalist design.

The goal of this site is to provide a clear, engaging experience that focuses on content and creativity without unnecessary clutter. Every element, from typography to image assets, has been chosen to contribute to a seamless experience.
